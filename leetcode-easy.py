""" version number comparison """

# The goal of this question is to write a function, in a language of
# your choice, that will compare two version number strings. Version
# number strings are strings like "1.2.3" or "2.12.4". They are strings
# of digits separated by periods. You may assume that the strings do
# not contain any other characters.
#
# The comparison function will take 2 such strings as inputs, and
# return an integer as the result. If the input strings are "a" and
# "b", the function should return:
#
# 1, if a > b
# 0, if a == b
# -1, if a < b
#
# The comparison needs to be based on the version numbers. This
# comparison is defined by considering each component integer of the
# strings pairwise. Here are some examples:
#
# 2.12 > 2.2 (because 12 > 2)
# 1.2.3 == 1.2.3
# 1.2.0 == 1.2
# 1.2.0.0 == 1.2
# 1.2.0.0.0.0 == 1.2.0.0
# 1.2.0.1 > 1.2.0.0
# 1.2.10 < 1.2.12
# 1.3.2 > 1.2.3
# 1.2 < 1.2.0.1

'''Leetcode: Remove Duplicates '''
'''
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores). '''

''' Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears 
only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first 
part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums 
should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.'''
